### Phase 9 — Enhanced Objective Visibility & Analytics 🚧 IN PROGRESS
**Status**: Planning/Ready to implement

**Goal**: Make objectives visible and actionable at a glance, with RAG tiles, detailed table columns, sparklines, impact estimates, and time-based trends.

#### 1) KPI Tiles (RAG) That Reflect Objectives
**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Second row of tiles driven by task's Objective KPI and latest measurement deltas
- [ ] **CTR tasks tile**: On track / At risk / Overdue (RAG), plus net CTR delta across active CTR tasks
- [ ] **Rank tasks tile**: Count of tasks with rank improved / worsened / flat since baseline
- [ ] **AI tasks tile**: Count of pages with AI Overview on but citations = 0 (actionable "gap" tile)
- [ ] **Measurement freshness tile**: Tasks with last measurement > 30d or missing baseline/latest
- [ ] Each tile clickable to filter table

**Why it's better**: Tells you what's happening in the objectives, not just workflow state.

#### 2) Objective Progress Columns in Table
**Deliverables**:
- [ ] **Objective KPI column**: Display KPI type (e.g., CTR (28d), Rank, AI Citations)
- [ ] **Target column**: Direction + value (e.g., "Increase by +1.00pp", "Decrease to rank 5")
- [ ] **Baseline → Latest column**: Compact version showing baseline → latest values
- [ ] **Δ vs baseline column**: Formatted delta (e.g., "+0.12pp", "-3", "+2")
- [ ] **RAG progress column**: On track / At risk / Overdue status badge
- [ ] **Due in column**: Days remaining (e.g., "12d") or "Overdue 4d"
- [ ] **Last measured column**: Date + "Needs update" indicator if > 30d or missing

**Why it's better**: Stop opening modals just to understand progress - everything visible in table.

#### 3) Mini Sparklines
**Deliverables**:
- [ ] **Option A**: Per-task sparkline (tiny line) for objective KPI, last ~6–10 measurements
- [ ] **Option B**: Per-KPI trend (one sparkline per KPI tile)
- [ ] Using measurement history data
- [ ] Visual trend indicator showing if metric is moving up/down/flat

**Why it's better**: Makes dashboard feel "alive" and quickly answers "is this moving?"

#### 4) Estimated Impact Tiles
**Deliverables**:
- [ ] **CTR impact tile**: Estimated extra clicks available
  - Formula: `impressions_28d * (target_ctr - current_ctr)` summed across active CTR tasks
  - Shows potential value of completing CTR objectives
- [ ] **AI citation gap tile**: 
  - Count of tasks where AI Overview = On and AI Citations = 0
  - Optionally weighted by opportunity score
  - Shows actionable gap size

**Why it's better**: Extremely motivating and prioritises correctly - shows real business impact.

#### 5) Time-Based Charts
**Deliverables**:
- [ ] **Active objectives by KPI over time**: Stacked counts by week/month
  - Shows how many objectives are active for each KPI type over time
- [ ] **Net movement trend**: 
  - Median rank change for rank objectives
  - Average CTR change for CTR objectives
  - Only includes tasks with measurements in last 30 days
  - Shows overall progress trend

**Why it's better**: Simple, not clutter - gives high-level view of optimisation program health.

- `optimisation_task_events` - Timeline events (measurements, notes, cycle changes)

### Key Views
- `vw_optimisation_task_status` - Aggregated status view for table display
- `vw_optimisation_task_goal_status` - Goal status calculation (if exists)

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/optimisation/tasks` - List tasks (supports share mode)
- `GET /api/optimisation/task/[id]` - Get task details (supports share mode)
- `POST /api/optimisation/task` - Create task (admin only)
- `PATCH /api/optimisation/task/[id]` - Update task (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/optimisation/task/[id]` - Delete task (admin only)
- `POST /api/optimisation/task/[id]/objective` - Update objective (admin only)

## Data Model Summary

### Objective Schema (JSONB)
```json
{
  "title": "string",
  "kpi": "clicks_28d|impressions_28d|ctr_28d|current_rank|opportunity_score|ai_overview|ai_citations",
  "target": number|boolean,
  "target_type": "delta|absolute",
  "due_at": "ISO date string|null",
  "plan": "string|null"
}
```

### Progress Object (JSONB)
```json
{
  "baseline_value": number|null,
  "latest_value": number|null,
  "delta": number|null,
  "target": number,
  "target_type": "delta|absolute",
  "remaining_to_target": number|null
}
```

### Status Values
- `objective_status`: `not_set`, `on_track`, `overdue`, `met`
- `cycle_status`: `planned`, `in_progress`, `monitoring`, `done`, `paused`, `cancelled`, `completed`, `archived`
- `event_type`: `created`, `note`, `change_deployed`, `measurement`, `status_changed`, `cycle_start`, `cycle_completed`, `cycle_archived`

---

## Known Issues / Limitations

1. **CTR with baseline = 0**: Relative percentage increases are undefined. Currently shows as percentage points.
2. **Measurement idempotency**: 5-minute cooldown prevents duplicate measurements.
3. **Share tokens**: No expiration enforcement (relies on manual rotation of `ARP_SHARE_KEY`).

- [x] Set objective with KPI, target, timeframe
- [x] Add measurement (captures current metrics)
- [x] Start new cycle (increments number, sets baseline)
- [x] Complete cycle (marks as completed, creates event)
- [x] Archive cycle (marks as archived, creates event)
- [x] View cycle history (switch between cycles)
- [x] Share mode (read-only access)
- [x] Goal status calculation (on_track/overdue/met)
- [x] KPI formatting (CTR as pp, rank lower better, etc.)

## Recent Fixes (2025-12-21) - v1.7.1

### Traffic Lights Classification Fix
- **Issue**: Tasks were appearing in multiple metric columns (CTR task showing in CTR, Impressions, Clicks, Rank)
- **Fix**: Only classify and count metrics that match the task's objective KPI
- **Result**: CTR task only appears in CTR column, AI Citations task only in AI Citations column

### Traffic Lights Baseline Detection Fix
- **Issue**: "No baselineLatest" warnings for tasks with single measurement
- **Fix**: Updated `getBaselineLatest` to handle single measurement case when filtered by cycle start date
- **Result**: Traffic lights can now classify tasks with baseline-only measurements

### Ranking & AI Task Creation Fix
- **Issue**: Tasks created from Ranking & AI were missing keyword and title
- **Root Cause**: Task type was hardcoded to `'on_page'`, which forced `keyword_text` to empty string
- **Fix**: 
  - Changed Ranking & AI task type from `'on_page'` to `'content'` (keyword-level tasks)
  - Modal now suggests keyword as title for keyword-level tasks
  - API preserves keyword_text for non-page-level tasks
- **Result**: Tasks created from Ranking & AI now have correct keyword and title

### Bulk Update Button Fix
- **Issue**: Bulk update was including test tasks even when checkbox was unchecked
- **Fix**: Added check to filter out test tasks if "Include Test Tasks" checkbox is unchecked
- **Result**: Bulk update respects the test tasks filter

### Bulk Update Safety & Freshness (2025-12-24)
- **Change**: Bulk update no longer hard-blocks on Ranking & AI data for URL-only tasks.
- **Change**: Added a staleness nudge when Ranking & AI snapshot is missing/stale (for keyword-based tasks).
- **Change**: Added fallback to `localStorage.rankingAiData` when Ranking & AI rows are not in memory.

### URL-only Tasks: AI Overview/Citations (2025-12-24)
- **Fix**: URL-only (`on_page`) tasks now populate **AI Overview** and **AI Citations** by scanning Ranking & AI cited URLs (`ai_alan_citations`) for the task’s page URL.
- **UX**: “AI Overview” shows **Present / Not present / —** (unknown) to avoid false negatives when ranking data isn’t available.
